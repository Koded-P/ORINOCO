<h1>Orinoco</h1>
<h2>Project Brief</h2>
<p>Sheila, a friend of yours from school, called you last week, telling you she has been approaching investors for her new online sales business, Orinoco.</p>
<p>As opposed to an Amazon-style, one site-sells-all web app, Sheila wants to set up specific, themed apps which only sell one group of products each. She knows that you work in web development, so of course she thought of you and was happy to hear that you were interested in contributing.</p>

<h2>Software Requirements Specification</h2>
<p>The back-end has already been set up with APIs for three themed stores of which this projects goes with the API containing Camera products.</p>

<p>The front end will require 4 pages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>A list view page , showing all items available for sale.</p></li>
    <li><p>A single product page (using URL query parameters), which will dynamically</p></li>
    <li><p>show the item selected by the user, display a description and price in dollars, and allow users to personalize the product and add it to their cart.</p></li>
    <li><p>A cart page (using the localStorage JavaScript functionality), showing a summary of products in the cart, the total price, and a form with which to submit an order.</p></li>
    <li><p>An order confirmation page , thanking the user for their order, showing the total price and the order ID returned by the server</p></li>
</ul>
